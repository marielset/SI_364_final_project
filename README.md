This project was created by Mariel Setton

To run the program, first create the database msetton_364_final. 
Then run the command 'python msetton.py runserver' in your command prompt.
Simply going to localhost:5000/ will redirect you to the main page of the application.

For my application, enter a song that you have heard that you do not necessarily know many details about.
The application will return details about the song and save it to a database. At this point you will have two options, to continue searching for songs or to send the new song to a friend!

If you choose to send the song to a friend, you will be able to enter an email or pick from previously saved friends. 
Those friends will be specific to your account and will not be able to be seen by anyone else. 
At this point you will also be asked to log in or register. You must do that in order to continue.

There is another page to view all the songs you have already saved.
